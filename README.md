## Open Targets Top 5 Disease-Target Associations Scores for [Lung Carcinoma](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo/terms?short_form=EFO_0001071)

This app was developed using Flask as the REST API server and ReactJS as the front end framework.

#### Run the backend server

```script
cd backend/
```

Set up the python environment

```script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Flask
```script
export FLASK_APP=app
flask run
```

Flask should now be running on the default address, which is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
